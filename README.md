# Rustmember

If you always forget that one command you use every day but still can't remember it, or you have to run long sequences of commands then **rustmember** is here to help you

**rustmember** is a terminal application that acts as a database of commands with short and/or long explanations, and stands out for offering the possibility of copying them to the clipboard in a very simple way.

## Usage

**rustmember is still in an early state of development**. You can compile and use it but you may not be as happy with it as you will be in a more advanced state.

If you still want to try it, you can do 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:apereiroc/rustmember.git
cd rustmember
cargo run -- --filename examples/demo.json
```
